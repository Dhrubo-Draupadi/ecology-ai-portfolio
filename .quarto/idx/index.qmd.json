But plants don’t want their leaves to get too hot — so they cool them down by releasing heat into the air.\\\n\\\nThis cooling depends partly on leaf shape. A flat, simple leaf has a smoother edge and holds onto a thicker \"blanket\" of still air around it. In contrast, a highly divided or compound leaf (with deep cuts or many small leaflets) has more edge area and breaks up that air blanket. This helps it release heat faster, like rolling down your sleeves on a hot day.\\\n\\\nWe made a computer model to explore this idea. It shows that as a leaf becomes more cut or divided:\\\n - It can cool down more efficiently\\\n - Its temperature drops, which helps the plant stay healthy in hot weather\\\n\\\nThis kind of model helps scientists understand why plants in hot or dry places often have finely divided or compound leaves — it’s nature’s clever way of staying cool. 🌞🍃\n\n![](images/clipboard-2222198179.png)\n\n📊 Analysis of Real and Virtual Data\n\n# Understanding Woody Plant Diversity in a Northern Western Ghats Forest\n\n![](images/clipboard-3942456751.png){width=\"419\"}\n\n## Figure 1: Relative Abundance-Weighted Trait Space\n\n![](images/clipboard-3860100359.png){width=\"495\"}\n\n## Figure 2: Clusters of Woody Plants Based on Traits\n\n# Exploring Adaptive Landscapes of Imaginary Carnivorous Plants\n\n![](images/clipboard-711190598.png)\n\n<iframe src=\"www/adaptivelandscape.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"800px\" frameborder=\"0\">\n\n</iframe>\n\nSLA - Specific Leaf Area\n\n🌊 Ocean Waves\n\n<video width=\"600\" controls autoplay loop muted>\n\n<source src=\"videos/Ocean-waves.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n\n</video>\n\nThis video captures the calming motion of the sea, echoing ecological harmony.\n\n## 🌐 AI-Generated Wave\n\n![Wave surface generated using AI](videos/ai-wave.gif)\n\n## 🔊 Song\n\nThis is a song I made using AI tools: Dreamy Daisies\n\n<audio controls>\n\n<source src=\"Audios/dreamy-daisies.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element. </audio>\n\n## 🌐 Passes in the Pay Wall Are Lower with AI\n\n> “Technology can build bridges over walls — and AI is laying the first planks.”\n>\n> # Conversation on Plant Morpho Evo Devo\n>\n> ## User:\n>\n> There's a trend in plant sciences review called plant morpho evo devo, could you give me the link to it\n>\n> ## Assistant:\n>\n> Certainly!

It explores fleeting universes of affection, the asymmetry of emotional investment, and the elusive nature of clarity in human relationships.\\\n\\\nThemes and Interpretation\\\n\\\n 1. Unreciprocated or Misunderstood Love\\\n\"unsolicited loves / universes but in blip...\"\\\nThe opening suggests spontaneous, unasked-for affections that appear momentarily—like a cosmic accident, a “blip” in a multiverse. These emotions are intense yet ephemeral, perhaps not reciprocated or even recognized.\\\n\\\n2. Emotional Transaction and Retrospection\\\n\"requite bartered to be seen / as this gargantuan centridextrous mind retrospect\"\\\nLove becomes a barter, exchanged awkwardly, possibly unbalanced. The word \"centridextrous\"—a likely neologism—could signify a mind that reaches inward and outward, ambidextrous in handling emotion and thought, but ultimately lost in retrospection.\\\n\\\n3. Longing, Melancholy, and Surreal Imagery\\\n\"when the dews reflect / Dhrubo, anything but you intense!\"\\\n\"Dhrubo\" appears as a central figure—possibly a muse, a past love, or the narrator themselves in self-dialogue. Dewdrops reflecting memories evoke tender but painful nostalgia.\\\n\\\nMiddle Movement: A Bittersweet Exchange\\\n\\\n\"Epiphanies line up / so long their queue\"\\\nHere, epiphanies—moments of clarity—are abundant, yet realization is cast as an outcast. Joy is compared to a drink at a bar: served, traded, and consumed, but ultimately leaving behind sorrow.\\\n\\\n\"I glue my song with your tears... yet their weight you cannot bear\"\\\nThe poet weaves a tapestry of intimacy from the other’s tears, suggesting deep empathy, though the subject remains emotionally overwhelmed or detached. There's a beauty in fragility (\"lustrous thread\") that the other person cannot handle.\\\n\\\nFinal Movement: Creation and Collapse\\\n\\\n\"You burst the rainbow bubble a blip...\"\\\nThe subject of the poem destroys a magical moment, perhaps unintentionally, by failing to appreciate its delicacy. There's an attempt to weave meaning (\"warp and weft\"), but it remains incomplete, an emotionally unfinished garment.\\\n\\\n\"the cold bites your collar bones / the heat burns your hair...\"\\\nNow nature itself turns against this person, suggesting emotional consequences or karmic recoil. Yet the speaker restrains judgment, saying, “but Dhrubo dare you complain / cause you more intense”—perhaps acknowledging that sensitivity itself is a burden.\\\n\\\nWhat Might the Author Be Thinking?\\\n\\\nThe poet is likely grappling with the aftermath of a profound emotional connection—a love that was vivid, momentary, and deeply introspective. There’s a tension between yearning to be understood and the sorrow of misalignment.\\\n\\\nBy using metaphors like threads, light, dew, and cosmic blips, the poet universalizes personal grief and affection. It feels like an attempt to reconcile vulnerability with resilience, to find coherence in emotional chaos.\n\n## 🌿 Ecology – A Haiku by GPT\n\n::: poem\nRoots speak underground\\\nfungi weave silent stories\\\nlife whispers in webs\n:::\n\n## 🔗 External Simulations\n\n### 🔁 Lotka-Volterra Competition Simulator\n\nExplore interspecific competition using the classic Lotka-Volterra model.
