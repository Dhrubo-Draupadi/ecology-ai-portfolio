# 🌿 Welcome!

Hi I am Dhrubo (They/She)! Welcome to my portfolio, I mostly have nature & ecology-inspired projects that I executed using AI tools I learnt during the course.

This simulated demographic heatmap explores the fictional province of *Trannsylvania*, modeling spatial variation in **cis-to-trans population ratios**.\
Warmer hues highlight areas with higher cis presence, offering a satirical-yet-insightful commentary on social identity landscapes and how AI can visualize them creatively.

# How Leaf Shape Affects Its Temperature

Leaves absorb sunlight and get warm, just like your skin on a sunny day. But plants don’t want their leaves to get too hot — so they cool them down by releasing heat into the air.\
\
This cooling depends partly on leaf shape. A flat, simple leaf has a smoother edge and holds onto a thicker "blanket" of still air around it. In contrast, a highly divided or compound leaf (with deep cuts or many small leaflets) has more edge area and breaks up that air blanket. This helps it release heat faster, like rolling down your sleeves on a hot day.\
\
We made a computer model to explore this idea. It shows that as a leaf becomes more cut or divided:\
 - It can cool down more efficiently\
 - Its temperature drops, which helps the plant stay healthy in hot weather\
\
This kind of model helps scientists understand why plants in hot or dry places often have finely divided or compound leaves — it’s nature’s clever way of staying cool. 🌞🍃

## 📝 GPT Digested My Feelings Well

::: poem
unsolicited loves / universes but in blip...\
requite bartered to be seen\
as this gargantuan centridextrous mind retrospect

when the dews reflect\
Dhrubo, anything but you intense!

Epiphanies line up\
so long their queue\
but realization is recluse\
I glue my song with your tears\
yet their weight you cannot bear

you burst the rainbow bubble a blip...\
I wove warp and weft with air\
and the unseamed center\
collapsed

the cold bites your collar bones\
the heat burns your hair\
but Dhrubo dare you complain\
cause you more intense.
:::

This poem is a layered meditation on love, memory, and emotional vulnerability, delivered through surreal and lyrical imagery. It explores fleeting universes of affection, the asymmetry of emotional investment, and the elusive nature of clarity in human relationships.\
\
Themes and Interpretation\
\
 1. Unreciprocated or Misunderstood Love\
"unsolicited loves / universes but in blip..."\
The opening suggests spontaneous, unasked-for affections that appear momentarily—like a cosmic accident, a “blip” in a multiverse. These emotions are intense yet ephemeral, perhaps not reciprocated or even recognized.\
\
2. Emotional Transaction and Retrospection\
"requite bartered to be seen / as this gargantuan centridextrous mind retrospect"\
Love becomes a barter, exchanged awkwardly, possibly unbalanced. The word "centridextrous"—a likely neologism—could signify a mind that reaches inward and outward, ambidextrous in handling emotion and thought, but ultimately lost in retrospection.\
\
3. Longing, Melancholy, and Surreal Imagery\
"when the dews reflect / Dhrubo, anything but you intense!"\
"Dhrubo" appears as a central figure—possibly a muse, a past love, or the narrator themselves in self-dialogue. Dewdrops reflecting memories evoke tender but painful nostalgia.\
\
Middle Movement: A Bittersweet Exchange\
\
"Epiphanies line up / so long their queue"\
Here, epiphanies—moments of clarity—are abundant, yet realization is cast as an outcast. Joy is compared to a drink at a bar: served, traded, and consumed, but ultimately leaving behind sorrow.\
\
"I glue my song with your tears... yet their weight you cannot bear"\
The poet weaves a tapestry of intimacy from the other’s tears, suggesting deep empathy, though the subject remains emotionally overwhelmed or detached. There's a beauty in fragility ("lustrous thread") that the other person cannot handle.\
\
Final Movement: Creation and Collapse\
\
"You burst the rainbow bubble a blip..."\
The subject of the poem destroys a magical moment, perhaps unintentionally, by failing to appreciate its delicacy. There's an attempt to weave meaning ("warp and weft"), but it remains incomplete, an emotionally unfinished garment.\
\
"the cold bites your collar bones / the heat burns your hair..."\
Now nature itself turns against this person, suggesting emotional consequences or karmic recoil. Yet the speaker restrains judgment, saying, “but Dhrubo dare you complain / cause you more intense”—perhaps acknowledging that sensitivity itself is a burden.\
\
What Might the Author Be Thinking?\
\
The poet is likely grappling with the aftermath of a profound emotional connection—a love that was vivid, momentary, and deeply introspective. There’s a tension between yearning to be understood and the sorrow of misalignment.\
\
By using metaphors like threads, light, dew, and cosmic blips, the poet universalizes personal grief and affection. It feels like an attempt to reconcile vulnerability with resilience, to find coherence in emotional chaos.
